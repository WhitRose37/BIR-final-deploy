## 1. Introduction (The Hook)
"Good morning everyone.First of all thank you for coming here today. My name is Thapanawat panvijit, and today I am excited to present **Lumentum Part Generator**—an intelligent platform designed to revolutionize how we manage and generate industrial part specifications."

## 2. The Problem (The "Why")
"In the manufacturing and engineering world, creating detailed part specifications is often a bottleneck. It involves manual data entry, searching through endless catalogs, and cross-referencing technical documents. It’s time-consuming, prone to user error, and frankly, inefficient."

## 3. The Solution (The "What")
"Lumentum Part Generator changes this game. We have built a comprehensive web application that leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to automate the creation and management of manufacturing parts. Think of it as a smart assistant that understands engineering context."

## 4. Key Features (The "How")
"Let me walk you through the core capabilities of our platform:"

*   **AI-Powered Generation:** "At its core, users can simply describe a part in plain English, and our AI engine instantly generates a complete technical specification, including dimensions, materials, and standards." 
*   **Document Intelligence:** "We know data often lives in legacy files. Our system includes a powerful document processor that can read PDF and Word documents, extracting critical technical data automatically to speed up the workflow."
*   **Smart Search & Batch Processing:** "For high-volume needs, we offer semantic search and batch processing, allowing engineers to process thousands of items simultaneously, saving countless hours of manual work."

## 5. Technology Stack (The "Under the Hood")
"Technically, the platform is built on a robust modern stack: 
*   **Frontend:** Next.js 16 with TypeScript for a fast, responsive interface.
*   **Backend:** Secure API routes integrated with OpenAI for intelligence.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma for reliable data management.
*   **Security:** Enterprise-grade authentication and role-based access control." 
## 6. Conclusion & Vision
"In summary, Lumentum Part Generator isn't just a database; it's a productivity engine. We are moving from manual, error-prone processes to an automated, AI-driven future.

We are currently in the [mention current phase, e.g., 'Core AI Integration'] phase and are excited to see how this tool will transform our engineering workflows.

Thank you for your time. I’d be happy to answer any questions."
